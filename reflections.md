# App Limitations & Possible Improvements:
The 5th plot (boxplot of “Time spent in shelter”) has a log-transformation on the y-axis as the distributions seem to follow a power-curve. This is a limitation of the data, and also partly a limitation of Altair’s plotting manipulation of the y-axis as we cannot adjust it to make it more interpretable than what it already is. Thus, consumers of the visualisation may have to be warned on how to interpret the values on the y-axis. By default, the boxplot of Altair comes with enabled interactive depicting the quantiles breakdown. This also helps the user to extract out quantifiable summaries which mitigates the effect of the possibly confounding log-transformed y-axis.

In the dashboard, the information regarding age distribution of the intake animal can be seen. Drawing a similar parallel to that, a plot depicting age distribution of the out-take animal can be added in the future to help the shelter staff get more information on the age of the animals in the shelter.

Within the application, we create a General Filter for the timeframe, while also embedding specific filters for certain plots. Improvements in CSS or application HTML design would actually help users visualise how the filters relate to the plots.  

# Feedback and Rectification
Our TA gave us generally positive feedback but also highlighted some issues that we can improve on:

__1. We were not utilising Github’s issues functionality as often as we could__  
We utilised other modes of communication that we were very familiar with (such as Slack chat groups). Within these modes of communication, we also made it a point to create meeting summaries/to-do lists that anchored our project progress. With that in mind, we also do admit that we could learn how to use Github’s issues functionality more as it allows for proper documentation of every issue. Unfortunately, we only learned about this in our Lab session on Wednesday, but by then, we had sufficient discussion internally that most of our project tasks completed. 

__2. Our research questions were not clearly stated in our App description__  
We also rectified this by updating our Application description with proper research questions that tie in greatly with the envisioned use cases for our users to improve their operations. 

__3. Team Contract could be more clearly defined in terms of workload breakdown__  
Our initial team contract was based on general collaborative principles, and at the point of its creation, we did not want to create highly specific wording that binds us excessively. Our team was in agreement with the general principles (such as proper division of tasks and accountability or meetings should end with summarised deliverables with assignments and deadlines, etc), instead of highly specific wording that may not allow us to be flexible. To address the feedback, we revised our team contract with more specificity on terminology.

# Learnings 
Our team felt a sense of achievement and are particularly happy about how the app turned out. We were glad to learn and apply the techniques of Dash app applications, and we feel that the overall product was particularly effective for the envisioned use case.
